          1. <b>What is Mental Health?</b>
        </div>
        <div class="card-body">
          <p class="card-text">Mental health includes our emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It affects how we think, feel, and act. It also helps determine how we handle stress, relate to others, and make choices. Mental health is important at every stage of life, from childhood and adolescence through adulthood.</i><br><br>
            Over the course of your life, if you experience mental health problems, your thinking, mood, and behavior could be affected. Many factors contribute to mental health problems, including:</i><br>
            <ul>
                <li><i>Biological factors, such as genes or brain chemistry</i></li>
                <li><i>Life experiences, such as trauma or abuse</i></li>
                <li><i>Family history of mental health problems</i></li>
            </ul><br></p>

        </div>
        <div class="card-body">
          <p class="card-text">Emotional and mental health is important because it’s a vital part of your life and impacts your thoughts, behaviors and emotions. Being healthy emotionally can promote productivity and effectiveness in activities like work, school or caregiving. It plays an important part in the health of your relationships, and allows you to adapt to changes in your life and cope with adversity. Your mental health can get worst in these challenging times. So it's your responsibility to take care of your mental health.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="card-body">
          <p class="card-text">Fear, worry, and stress are normal responses to perceived or real threats, and at times when we are faced with uncertainty or the unknown. So it is normal and understandable that people are experiencing fear in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.<br><br>
            Added to the fear of contracting the virus in a pandemic such as COVID-19 are the significant changes to our daily lives as our movements are restricted in support of efforts to contain and slow down the spread of the virus. Faced with new realities of working from home, temporary unemployment, home-schooling of children, and lack of physical contact with other family members, friends and colleagues, it is important that we look after our mental, as well as our physical, health.</p>

          4. <b>How to maintain our mental health and awareness?</b>
        </div>
        <div class="card-body">
          <p class="card-text">It’s important to take care of yourself and get the most from life. Below are 10 practical ways to look after your mental health. Making simple changes to how you live doesn’t need to cost a fortune or take up loads of time. Anyone can follow this advice. Why not start today?<br><br>
          <ol>
              <li>Talk about your feelings - <b>Talking about your feelings can help you stay in good mental health and deal with times when you feel troubled and challenging.</b></li><br>
              <li>Keep Active - <b>Regular exercise can boost your self-esteem and can help you concentrate, sleep, and feel better. Exercise keeps the brain and your other vital organs healthy, and is also a significant benefit towards improving your mental health.</b></li><br>
              <li>Eat Well - <b>Your brain needs a mix of nutrients in order to stay healthy and function well, just like the other organs in your body. A diet that’s good for your physical health is also good for your mental health.</b></li><br>
              <li>Drink Sensibly - <b>We often drink alcohol to change our mood. Some people drink to deal with fear or loneliness, but the effect is only temporary. When the drink wears off, you feel worse because of the way the alcohol has affected your brain and the rest of your body. Drinking is not a good way to manage difficult feelings.</b></li><br>
              <li>Keep in touch with friends - <b>There’s nothing better than catching up with someone face to face, but that’s not always possible because of this covid-19 pandemic. You can also give them a call, drop them a note, or chat to them online instead. Keep the lines of communication open: it’s good for you!</b></li><br>
              <li>Ask for help when you need help- <b>None of us are superhuman. We all sometimes get tired or overwhelmed by how we feel or when things don’t go to plan. If things are getting too much for you and you feel you can’t cope, ask for help. Your family or friends may be able to offer practical help or a listening ear. Local services are there to help you.</b></li><br>
              <li>Take a break from hard work- <b>A change of scene or a change of pace is good for your mental health. It could be a five-minute pause from cleaning your kitchen, a half-hour lunch break at work, or a weekend exploring somewhere new. A few minutes can be enough to de-stress you. Give yourself some ‘me time’.</b></li><br>
              <li>Do something you're good at - <b>What do you love doing? What activities can you lose yourself in? What did you love doing in the past?. Enjoying yourself can help beat stress. Doing an activity you enjoy probably means you’re good at it, and achieving something boosts your self-esteem.</b></li><br>
              <li>Accept who you are - <b>We’re all different. It’s much healthier to accept that you’re unique than to wish you were more like someone else. Feeling good about yourself boosts your confidence to learn new skills, visit new places and make new friends. Good self-esteem helps you cope when life takes a difficult turn.</b></li><br>
              <li>Look out for each others - <b>Caring for others is often an important part of keeping up relationships with people close to you. It can even bring you closer together.</b></li>

          <p class="card-text">Bad habits may be sucking the joy right out of your life.<br><br>You probably already know that bad habits can make you sick.

These habits can increase your risk of depression, for example, or cause you to feel more anxious or stressed out.<br><br>These ten bad habits may be sabotaging your mental health:
